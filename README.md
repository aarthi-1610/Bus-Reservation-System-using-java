# 🚌 Bus Reservation System using Java

## 📌 Project Description
The Bus Reservation System is a console-based Java application developed to automate the process of booking bus tickets. The system allows users to view available buses, check seat availability, and book tickets efficiently. It simplifies traditional manual booking by providing a fast, reliable, and user-friendly digital solution.

This project demonstrates strong implementation of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** such as classes, objects, encapsulation, and modular programming. It is ideal for learning real-world Java application development and system design.
